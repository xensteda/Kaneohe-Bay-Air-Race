# The Kaneohe Bay Air Race
Air race course in Hawaii for Flightgear Flight Simulator.
Installation instructions are located at the bottom of README.

This course is designed to be like the Red Bull Air Race tournaments.

This is just the pylons, no buildings are included.

Use PHNG Airbase, Runway 22 to reach the course with ease.

I also recommend the Hawaii Custom Scenery by D-ECHO:

https://github.com/D-ECHO/Hawaii-CustomScenery

ATTENTION:

When using the Addons Menu inside Flightgear to load the course:
Just make sure the KaneoheBayAirRace scenery is loaded on top
of D-ECHO's Hawaii Custom Scenery (if using it). The course will not show up if
it is loaded underneath the Hawaii-CustomScenery.
