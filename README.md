# The Kaneohe Bay Air Race
 
The file contains an air racing course located at Kaneohe, Hawaii inspired
by the professional air racing tournaments sponsored by Red Bull. The XML file
can be added to Flightgear in the Settings Menu.

For Linux and Mac OS user:
You will have to change the "absolute-path" in the XML file so it
Makes sense for your respective OS.

Windows users, it should be fine how I have it, please
Let me know uf you encounter any issues.

The file just has the racing pylons, no buildings are included.

The best way to get to the course is using Runway 22 at PHNG Airbase.

I highly recommend the Hawaii Custom Scenery by D-ECHO:
