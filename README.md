# The Flightgear Kaneohe Bay Air Race
Air race course in Hawaii for Flightgear Flight Simulator.

This course is designed to be like the Red Bull Air Race tournaments.

This is just the pylons, no buildings are included.

Use PHNG Airbase, Runway 22 to reach the course with ease.

I also recommend the Hawaii Custom Scenery by D-ECHO:
