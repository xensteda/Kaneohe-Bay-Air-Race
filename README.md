The file contains an air racing course located at Kaneohe, Hawaii inspired
by the professional air racing tournaments sponsored by Red Bull. The XML file
can be added to Flightgear in the Settings Menu.

The file just has the racing pylons, no buildings are included.

I highly recommend the Hawaiia Custom Scenery by D-ECHO:
